Fireside
========

Blazing fast Servlet 3.x API for WSGI apps running on Jython that
works with standard setuptools. Note this is not a direct replacement
for ModJy, which offers more support for other types of setups (but
not readily for working with setuptools).

Some initial documentation on how to use Fireside is found in the
[HelloWSGI][] sample application.
